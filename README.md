This repository provides an implementation of a quantum autoencoder for quantum error correction.

## Overview

Quantum computers are prone to errors due to their sensitive nature, making error correction vital. In this project, we propose a method for quantum error correction using a quantum autoencoder.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShunRyuzaki/qgvl-for-qec.git
